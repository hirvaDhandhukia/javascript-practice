2. Changing inner text when turns change from X to O when turns change in the gameInfo element (used the same change operator function)
3. Defined a set of array for win positions and defined a winner on basis of the X & O's position
4. Creating a box like structure for the game platform with html & css
5. Erasing every innerTexts when reset button is clicked
6. When reset btn is clicked, show Turn of X in the gameInfo element
